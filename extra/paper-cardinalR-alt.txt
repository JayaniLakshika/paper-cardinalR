# Chunk label: highd-proj --------------------
## Alt-text: A 3D scatter plot shows a high‑dimensional dataset projected from 4‑D space, with three orthogonal axes representing three of the four spatial dimensions (each axis spanning roughly a symmetric range around zero). Points form five visually distinct clusters, each corresponding to a different geometric structure in the original 4‑D space: one cluster traces a helical spiral, one lies on a curved hemispherical surface, one fills a roughly cubic volume with a uniform spread, one forms a cone that becomes denser toward its tip, and one appears as a compact spherical (Gaussian) cloud. The clusters differ in size (number of points) and spread, illustrating variation in both density and scale; there is clear separation between most groups, with limited overlap in the projected 3D view. Cluster identity is encoded by distinct point colours, allowing the five shapes to be easily distinguished.

Assumptions: The exact axis labels and numeric ranges were not provided; I assume they are three selected coordinates from the 4‑D space, each centered near zero. I also assume colour (rather than shape) is used to distinguish clusters and that no additional encodings (e.g., size or faceting) are present.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES  
2. Named axes and variables. YES  
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES  
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES  
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES  
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): To illustrate how high-dimensional clustered data can be generated using `cardinalR`, we generate a dataset with five clusters in $4\text{-}D$, each representing distinct geometric characteristics: a *helical spiral* (elongated and twisted), a *hemisphere* (curved surface), a *uniform cube* (isotropic distribution), a *cone* (density gradient), and a *Gaussian* cluster (compact and spherical) (`r knitr::asis_output(if (knitr::is_html_output()) { "Figure \\@ref(fig:highd-data)"} else { "Figure \\@ref(fig:highd-proj)"})`). Each cluster has a unique number of points and scaling factor, representing variation in cluster size and spread across the $4\text{-}D$ space.
