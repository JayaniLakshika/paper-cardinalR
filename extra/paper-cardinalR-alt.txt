# Chunk label: branch-proj --------------------
## Alt-text: The figure is most likely a 2D scatter plot showing synthetic “branches” in a high‑dimensional space projected onto a single 2D subspace. The horizontal axis represents one coordinate of the selected 2D subspace and the vertical axis represents the other coordinate; both axes appear to be on a continuous numeric scale with roughly symmetric ranges (for example, around −3 to 3), as is typical for standardized synthetic data. Points are grouped visually into several elongated clusters or “branches” that radiate or curve through the plane, with each branch corresponding to an active coordinate pair from the underlying high‑dimensional data. Branches that share the same 2D subspace (when `allow_share = TRUE`) overlap in this plot, while those with different active pairs appear in distinct directions or shapes; branches are likely distinguished by colour (one colour per branch) and possibly by point shape if multiple branch types are present. Overall, the plot illustrates that the generator produces clearly separated, structured branches in 2D projections, sometimes overlapping when subspaces are reused.

Assumptions: The exact axis labels and numeric limits are not given; I assume standard continuous coordinate axes with symmetric ranges and that different branches are encoded using colour and/or shape based on typical usage in such examples.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES  
2. Named axes and variables. YES  
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES  
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES  
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES  
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): High-dimensional generalizations are provided by `gen_orglinearbranches(n, p, k)` (`r knitr::asis_output(if (knitr::is_html_output()) { "Figure \\@ref(fig:branch)"} else { "Figure \\@ref(fig:branch-proj)"})`) and `gen_orgcurvybranches(n, p, k)`. For branch $i$, the active coordinate pair $(i_1, i_2)$ indexes the selected $2\text{-}D$ subspace. When `allow_share = TRUE`, multiple branches may share the same subspace; otherwise, subspaces are sampled without replacement until all possible $\binom{p}{2}$ combinations are exhausted, after which additional branches may repeat subspaces.
