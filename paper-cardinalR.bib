 abstract = {For example, imagine the reaction of a student who, upon completing an assignment of fitting a given multiple linear regression model and examining residual plots, is confronted with the residual plot in Figure 1(a), which contradicts G.E.P. Box's famous quotation about all models being wrong in the same way that Professor Jones's discovery under the Roman numeral ten contradicted his assertion that X never marks the spot (a residual plot version of which appears in Figure 1(b)). Of course, if the regression assignment is due just prior to a "big game," then the student might be more intrigued by residual plots of the sort in Figures 1(c) and (d). Figure 1(e) depicts Homer Simpson explaining how to embed images in regression residual plots. And if the residual plots in (a)—(e) are not attention-getting enough, the student who is unexpectedly confronted with the residual plot in Figure 1(f) is certainly going to be buffaloed (perhaps "bisoned" is taxonomically more correct but not grammatically).},
