Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

We are pleased to submit our article titled *“cardinalR: Generating interesting high-dimensional data structures”* for your consideration for publication in *The R Journal*. In this work, we introduce the `cardinalR` package, which provides flexible tools for generating a wide variety of high-dimensional data structures. The package is designed to assist researchers in creating true models for simulation studies, benchmarking, teaching, and method development. Our aim is to offer generally useful and well-documented functions that can be applied across a range of statistical and data science applications.

We believe that this contribution will be of broad interest to readers of *The R Journal*, particularly those involved in developing and testing new methods for clustering, nonlinear dimension reduction, and visualization. The package provides clear instructions and reproducible tools that can help users simulate data with meaningful geometric and statistical properties in any number of dimensions. We hope this work will support the community in generating high-quality examples for evaluating methods and illustrating concepts, while also encouraging the development of custom data structures for specialized needs.

We feel that *The R Journal* is the ideal venue for sharing this work, given its commitment to advancing the R ecosystem through high-quality, open-source contributions. We look forward to your feedback, and hope that `cardinalR` will serve as a valuable resource for the community.
